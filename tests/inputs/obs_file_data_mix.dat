# Observations data file

# Passband info could be (1) a path to a file or (2) a tophat filter
# defined by a central wavelength, half-width, and optionally a name

# Comment lines (like this one) and blank lines are ignored,
# central-wavelength and half-width units are always microns

# @DEPTH_UNITS sets the depth and uncert units (none, percent, ppt, ppm)
# and also indicates that there's data and uncerts to read
# as two columns before the passband info
@DEPTH_UNITS
ppm

# depth uncert  wavelength half_width passband_name
# depth uncert  passband_file
