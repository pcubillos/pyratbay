/home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/develop/BART/inputs/atmosph_new.dat


*****  Sun Jun 15 16:13:44 EDT 2014  *****

readlinedb.py:  Renamed readlinedb to readheader.  Wrote checkrange.
ptools:  Added warning function.  Adapted msg to print sentences (i.e.
         separate by \n).  Set up call to readlinetransition.
pconstants.py:  Added maxnamelen and strfmt.
objects.py:  Structured the linetransition, databases and isotopes classes.


*****  Sun Jun 22 13:40:06 EDT 2014  *****

Current plan: read line transitions in Python, send to cpyrat.  Check times.

readlinedb.py: Wrote readlintransition function.
ptools.py: Implemented binary search for TLI file.
pconstants.py added tlireclen.


*****  Sun Jun 29 12:45:21 EDT 2014  *****

I will use the log-pressure array as the base for the layers sampling.
Changed pyrat.atm -> pyrat.atmf  (the input atmospheric file)
Now pyrat.atm will be the modeling atm.

object.py: Renamed pyrat.uin -> pyrat.user
makesample.py: Started writing makeradius, Do Hydrostatic-Equilibrium
               calculation to get radius as a
               function of pressure, then interpolate to get pyrat.atm vals.


*****  Sun Jul  6 12:13:29 EDT 2014  *****

No pyrat work this week.  Put lineread up to date, for use with multiple
databases.


*****  Sun Jul 27 14:07:20 EDT 2014  *****

Upgrade pylineread from 4.0 to 5.0:
Main difference: 5.0 contains the molecule name for the isotope.

Moved /home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/pylineread/
to    /home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/pylineread/pylineread4.0

Created /home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/pylineread/pylineread5.0
with new implementation.

Modification from lineread v4.0:

- Changed endianness 'magic' variable to 'endian', changed the value to
  'b' or 'l' to be less criptic.
- Change wavelength to wavenumber
- Added isotopic abundance ratio info in TLI file.
- Added nTransitions before writting the transition data.
- Changed order in which the transition data is written: instead of
  wl1, id1, el1, gf1, wl2, id2, ... gfN.   do:
  wl1, wl2, ..., wlN, id1, id2, ... gfN.

updated PS, HIT, and TiO.

VO data is in: /home/esp01/code/bart/data/opacities/VO/


*****  Sun Aug  3 14:02:37 EDT 2014  *****

Adapt pyrat to pylineread5.0:
- Edited: - readlinedb.py
          - ptools.py

Updatded pyrat to work with pylineread5.0.  On the way fixed a couple of bugs:
  - readlinedb.py: The very last step when I count the number of transitions
    to read.
  - binsearch: Handle case when the sequential search went beyond boundaries.

I had to hack a few things, but will do a real test once we have /usr/local/
working again.  I foresee no troubles between now and then.

Stored old code in: /home/patricio/ast/esp01/pyrat/develop/old/readlinedb4.0/

That's it for now, I can't get much further without scipy working.  Now I will
continue upgrading transit to make it efficient.


*****  Sun Aug 10 13:37:02 EDT 2014  *****

Updated makewavenumner in makesample.py to print a warning on the modified
last sample point.  Also, make the sample to stay inside the user-defined
boundary.

In makeradius, changed interpolation kind from 'cubic' to 'slinear' because
cubic was failing.  Implemented partition-function interpolation from
pyrat.lt.db to pyrat.iso.

Fixed bug in readline.py: I was adding db.niso to iso.niso for each isotope
rather than for each db.


*****  Sun Aug 17 14:53:42 EDT 2014  *****

argum.c:
  - Removed maxratio argument. Added Tmin and Tmax arguments.
  - Updated calls pt.exit -> pt.error.
  - Updated string formatting calls (% -> {} format).
  - Added Doppler/Lorentz widths handling.

objects.py:
  - Added voigt and extinction objects and related variables.

readatm.py:
  - Using new molecules.dat file.  Added molecule symbol and universal ID info.

extinction.py:
  - Started extinction calculation.  Implemented The Doppler, Lorentz-width
    limits calculation and calculate the arrays.

pyrat.py:
  - Added ex.voigt() step.

Next to do: Calculate the Voigt-profiles grid.


*****  Sun Aug 24 12:55:13 EDT 2014  *****

extinction.py:
  - Implemented the calcvoigt() function to calculate the Voigt profiles.  The
    function uses a modified version of transit's newprofile wrapper and
    voigt.c module (modified as header file voigt.h).

Created the vprofile.c C-extension module:
  - Python wrapper to calculate the Voigt profile (called from extinction's
    calcvoigt() function).

voigt.h:
  - Copied and modified file from the transit project.

argum.py:
  - Renamed LDthresh to DLratio.


*****  Sun Aug 31 13:11:27 EDT 2014  *****

Implement cia.py to Read and interpolate the Collision Induced absorption.
  - Wrote two separate functions to read and interpolate the CIA absorption.
  - Investigate a bit more if I'm calculating well the extinction.

makesample.py:
  - makeradius(): Added molecular abundance and density profiles interpolation.
                  Updated most printing syntax.

pconstants.py:
  - Added amagat.


*****  Sun Jan 18 15:36:52 EST 2015  *****

Checking PyRaT status:
 + rename pyrat.user to pyrat.inputs
 - rewrite voigt to mimic current transit version
 - implement readlinedb's line-info read (think well how to proceed!)
   - can I make one single calc-extinction function?
 - replace toomuch by taumax.
 - rework makeradius to mimic current transit version.
 + move makesample.py pyrat.user checks to argum.py (mostly)
 + added pyrat.molfile.
 + set defaults for the Doppler and Lorentz widths.
 + removed wn nspec, added wnosamp.

 + implemented isgreater in argum.py to check if a value is greater
   than a given threshold.

"Moved (most) of input checks from makesample.py to argum.py.
Implemented isgreater in argum.py to check if a value is greater than
a given threshold."


*****  Mon Jan 19 09:56:24 EST 2015  *****

Today is not Sunday, but it's holiday.  So, let's get into it:

New PyRaT status:
 + Rewrite voigt to mimic current transit version
 - Implement readlinedb's line-info read (think well how to proceed!)
   - Can I make one single calc-extinction function?
 + Rename toomuch by maxdepth.
 + Rework makeradius (see below)
 + Finished cleaning makeradius of input checks.
 + Removed minelow, voigtbin.
 + Update readatm to new format.

- If atm file contains radius, take it.
  Else, calculate it with hydrostatic equilibrium.

- pmin and pmax constrain the atmospheric layers to those within
  [pmin, pmax] but no resample.
- radmin and radmax override pmax and pmin.  Still no resample.

- If nlayers is defined, resample to equi-spaced Delta logP sample.
- If radstep is defined, resample to equi-spaced Delta radius.

- readatm woks for two atm-file column configurations:
    [radius] pressure temperature abundace1 ... abundanceN
  (radius is optional).

Removed voigtbin.  Made voigt.c human-understandable.


*****  Sun Jan 25 11:42:01 EST 2015  *****

Added tstep to argum.py, some minor comment adjustments.

Worked in extinction.py, wrote most of opacity function, wrote
read_extinction function, started calc_extinction function; functions
need proper documentation.

Added extcoef.c function to calculate the extinction coefficient at a
given layer, work in progress, needs comments and documentation.

Some updates to objects.py.

Added pprint function to ptools to print arrays in a nicer way.


*****  Sun Feb  1 13:24:50 EST 2015  *****

This will be the package structure from now on:

 -pyrat/
   |--lineread.py
   |--pyrat.py
   |
   |--pysrc/
   |--csrc/
   |--inputs/
   |--log/
   |--run/

Copied pylineread from transit repo into pyrat repo.  Merged with
pylineread5.0 (/home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/pylineread/pylineread5.0/).
Rename as lineread.py.

Differences with transit repo:
- Endian encoding.
- wavelength --> wavenumber.

This week:
Re-engineered the package folders structure.
Finished vprofile function.
Added divisors function to ptools.
Fixed bug with species collision radius units.
Added extinction-coefficient C-routines to the repo.
Added lineread module (adapted to the pyrat code).


*****  Sun Feb  8 12:44:57 EST 2015  *****

Proof-of-concept, return pointers from C to Python:
  /home/patricio/ast/esp01/code/tests/python/pypointer

import vprofile as v
a = np.arange(10.) * np.pi
p = v.parse(a, 2, 3)
r = v.duplicate(p, 3)

But it appears to be breaking upon closure, ask Nate.

Open questions:
 - Can I keep a C pointer in C? What data type is?
 - How can I slice a PyArrayObject in C?

Renamed folders pysrc/ to src_Py/ and csrc/ to src_C/.
Started writing optical-depth module.
Finished writing (general) extinction-coefficient calculation C and
Python functions, runs from end to end, need to compare against
transit code.
Started sketching ext. coeff. interpolation function.
Fixed bugs in downsample function.
Found issues at the wavenumber ends, it appears it's not calculating
well the EC there.
Fixed bug in makerad sampling boundaries.
Fixed bug in makewn over-sampling array.
Fixed bug with linetransition isoid data type, added isoratio to
isotopes object, added index to voigt object, renamed profsize to size
in voigt object, added ec to extinction object.  Defined optdepth
object.


*****  Sun Mar  8 12:26:02 EDT 2015  *****

Done today:
- Renamed the repo from pyrat to Pyrat-Bay.  Made the repo private.
- Put the pyrat git repo into the Pyrat-Bay Github repo.
- Sorted repo folders.

Define the input atmospheric format:
- Per-layer data will have: pressure temperature abundances (no radius).
- Data is ordered from top layer to bottom layer.
- "#" indicate comments.
- "@" indicate a keyword:
  - '@ABUNDANCE' indicates if abundance is by mass or number.
  - '@PRESSURE' indicates the pressure units.
  - '@RADIUS indicates the radius units.
  - '@TEMPERATURE indicates the temperature units.
  - '@SPECIES' indicates the list of species.
  - '@DATA' indicates the per-layer data.

Reformated the atmospheric file.  Added current CIA files to repo.
Updated the config file.
Fixed readatm and makesample to read new format of atmospheric file.

"Updated the CIA inputs and cia.py to use the same format as the
atmospheric files."

"Implemented extinction-coefficient interpolation C code.  Need to test
the results.  Implemented valueinarray C code for pyrat.  Fixed bugs
in argum, extinction, and calc_extinction functions.
Added makeatm.py and optdepth.py to repo."


*****  Sun Mar 22 11:23:28 EDT 2015  *****

- Removed outdated atmospheric files.
- Need to reformat the atmospheric file:
   /home/patricio/ast/esp01/pyrat/develop/inputs/HD209458b.atm
  and add it to the repo.

While we ignore a wavelength-dependent refraction, we can assume that
the raypath at a given impact parameter will allways be the same.

Swapped axes of pyrat.cia.ec to be the same of pyrat.extinction.ec:
  [nlayers, nspec]

Fixed error in CIA interpolation, I was multiplying by q instead of density.
Recalculated the whole CIA thing:
   density in amagat = d/(mass*amu) / n0,
Then:  e[cm-1] = e[cm-1 amagat-2] * amagat^2

Renamed interpolated-CIA extinction coefficient from extinc to ec.
Got first version of optdepth running.  Seems slow with python
integrator (Simpson).  Implemented C Simpson rule (taken from scipy
implementation).  The integrator works.

I need to incorporate it to the Pyrat project next.

Added spectrum.py module.
Added timestamps to pyrat.py.
Added rstar argument for stellar radius.
Fixed bugs with simpson integration, results now are idential (within
  machine error) with scipy, though, my reoutine is faster.
Added temporary timestamps to makewavenumber.  The linspace for the
  oversampled array takes too long, find alternatives (C?).
Finished first running version of optdepth for transit geometry.

Known issues:
- The molecular extinction does not seem to be saveing the values (I
  see a lot o zeros).
- The transit spectrum is not right, somewhere in extinction/optical
  depth/modulation, there are problems.

Compare results against: /home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/transit/pyrat/


*****  Sun Apr 12 11:35:21 EDT 2015  *****

- Renamed transit config file to transit_pyrat.cfg,
  added eclipse config file: eclipse_pyrat.cfg.
- Fixed bug in extinction function for on-the-fly run.
- Stored line strength in array to avoid re-calculation.  Got a speed-up
  of ~20% in C extinction function.
- Created constants.h with constant values used in the C code.
- Added raygrid argument.
- Implemented eclipse geometry calculations in optdepth and spectrum.
- Implemented C blackbody function to calculate the Planck function.
- Implemented cutils file with C utilities.
- Corrected +/- sign in modulation spectrum integration.

- Pyrat transit geometry seems to be working now (reasonable qualitative
  results).  Transit seems to have a bug!  the baseline decreases when
  added line opacities.
- Pyrat agrees with Transit when there are no line opacities.
- Extinction is nearly twice as fast as Transit.
- Transit-Pyrat eclipse results agree: typically to < 1%, worst cases < 7%.

*****  Sun Apr 26 11:48:55 EDT 2015  *****

- Fixed bug in valueinarray (extracting double instead of integer).
- Fixed bugs in interpolating code.
- Got the code working with a extinction table.  Results are identical
  to on-the-fly calculations down to 0.3% difference.
- Optical-depth code is rather slow (~3 seconds).
- np.zeros vs np.empty does make some difference.
- Avoid having pt.msg inside loops (may make the code really slow).

- Implemented trapezoidal-rule integration.

For the optical depth, it does not make a difference wether we use
trapezoidal or simpson integration, the results are the same.
Having said that, a cumulative integration for eclipse geometry saves
us one while loop, thus improving the code speed by a factor of ~30.
For transit geometry, the intervals change for each inpact parameter,
thus we need a more cumbersome calculation.
The transit calculation is faster though, (higher optical depth and
simpler spectrum calculation).

- Rewrote the optical depth code in a simpler modular way (one step
  after the other).  It turns out that stopping the extinction
  calculation based on maximum optdepth doesn't make much difference
  now (specially in the case using an extinction table).  So now I'm
  simply calculating the extinction at all layers (making the code
  much much easier to follow).

*****

Up next:
- The transit path calculation can be easily written in C, and speed
  up the optdepth calc by some 30%.
- Re-write the main, separate code into init() and run().
- Add reload_atm() so the code will work in the Bayesian framework.


*****  Sun May  3 12:16:41 EDT 2015  *****

Re-wrote the pyrat.py main(), separating into init() and run().  Pyrat
can be run from the Interpreter now:

import sys
sys.path.append("../")
import pyrat as p

py = p.init("transit_pyrat.cfg")
py = p.run(py)

*****

Implemented reloadatm() in makesample.py.
- Should I put it in readatm.py instead?
- Should I remove the layer resampling code?  reloadatm() wont work if
  the atmosphere was resampled.
- Changed the spline interpolation for the partition function from
  cubic to linear.  Differ ences are less than 0.05%.  Linear is ~40
  times faster.

Up next:
- Double check that reloadatm works.


*****  Sun May 31 15:32:53 EDT 2015  *****

Downloaded Borysow's CIA H2-He data.  Made scripts to reformat the
given files for use in pyrat:
  /home/patricio/ast/esp01/pyrat/develop/scripts/Borysow_merge_H2H2.py
  /home/patricio/ast/esp01/pyrat/develop/scripts/Borysow_merge_H2He.py

Added if-statement to skip Voigt-profile calculation when reading an
extinction-coefficient table.  Likewise for the line-transition
reading.

Put Voigt-profile related functions into its own module: voigt.py.

Added error message when an atmospheric species is not listed in the
molecular info file, and when a CIA species is not listed in the
atmospheric file.

Updated Borysow's H2-H2 CIA file, and added H2-He file.
Tested the Borysow's H2-He CIA absorption file.
Tested multiple CIA files.  The code seems to be working well in all cases.

Updated hitran.dat and molecules.dat files.
Updated demo files to include current CIA files.

*****

Up next:
 - Wait for AJ for TIPS news.
 - Implement and test multiple TLI files.
 - Start thinking about the Pyrat-Bay synnergy (even if MC3 is still
   not ready).
 - Setup the project's Github README (medium priority?).
 - Implement HITRAN CIA absorption (wait for AJ?) (low priority?).

Test Pyrat in OSX Mavericks:

By removing the compilation flags for open MP:
   extra_compile_args=['-fopenmp']
   extra_link_args=['-lgomp']
Pyrat compiles and runs in OSX 10.9.5 (Hurray!)

In general it's much faster than exo. However, the CIA interpolation
is really slow:

*****

Implemented modified version of reader.py (TEP file reader), renamed
as TEP.  Re-worked a bit.  Added method to print the parametes used in
the Pyrat-Bay project.

*****

Drafted pbay.py, the main Pyrat-Bay driver code.


*****  Sun Jun 21 12:05:55 EDT 2015  *****

In lineread.py: Included the number of transitions per isotope,
cleaned code (removed unused imports, standarized writing syntax).

In pconstants.py: Added Pyrat-Bay, Pyrat, and Lineread version (major,
minor, and revision).  Bumped Lineread minor revision to 1 (Now version
6.1.0).  Set Pyrat version to 1.0.0.

In readlinedb.py: Added check for TLI version.  Adapted to read TLI
version 6.1.  Standarized writting-to-screen syntax (use format()).

In ptools.py: Added unpack() function (wrapper of struct.unpack).

*****

Added CTIPS code as sub-module (using this command):
  git submodule add https://github.com/pcubillos/ctips
and re-factored the db_hitran.py code to use it.

Should I keep the sub-modules inside a 'modules/' folder?
I don't have any strong feeling about it.  I will keep them at
top-level directory for the moment.

Bumped Lineread minor version (Now version 6.2.0).
Bumped Pyrat revision (Now version 1.0.1).

*****

Re-factored readlinedb.py code to accept multiple TLI files.
Tested: 2DB in TLI1 + 1DB in TLI2
    vs. 1DB in TLI1 + 2DB in TLI2
    vs. 3DB in TLI1.
Multiple TLI entries produce the exact same output when given as a
single TLI file.

Cosmetic changes in objects.py and spectrum.py.

Bumped Pyrat minor version (Now version 1.1.0).


*****  Sun Jun 28 14:48:59 EDT 2015  *****

What about this?
- Let part_list continue being a path when we want to read a table,
  but let it be a flag (e.g., ctips) when we want to calculate it with
  a method.
- The method should not live in the db_ class, maybe in the driver?

*****

Added examples/ folder with respective sub-folders for each executable
of the project.  Moved the pyrat config files here (from run/).
Deleted the run/ folder.

Added lineread example config file: demo_hitran.cfg (for HITRAN H2O
database).

Updated eclipse and transit Pyrat config files.  Added demo
atmospheric file with vertical-uniform abundances to the pyrat_demo/
folder.  Still need to set the correct paths.

Tiny cosmetic edit in lineread.py.

In pconstants.py: Bumped lineread revision (now version 6.2.1).

*****

In objects.py: Created Spectrum class.  Moved Pyrat's wavenumber,
wavelength, and spectrum variables into the Spectrum object.  Declared
all of the Pyrat-object attributes.
Modified accordingly: argum.py, cia.py, extinction.py, makesample.py,

Implemented Gauss-quadrature option to integrate the intensity
over the day-side hemisphere.
Added warning for raygrid default.

I get similar flux values with quadrature integration than before.
Typical differences range from 0.1% - 0.5% for test case.  Quadrature
seems to give more weight towards the substellar point.
The higher the degree the smaller the difference, which makes me think
that the previos integration scheeme is more correct (though this is
just a conjecture).
The other issue is that I still don't know how to get weights for
custom nodes (pretty sure there's something out there that does this).

Bumped Pyrat to version 1.2.14.


*****  Mo 6. Jun 09:03:27 CEST 2016  *****

Fixed bug in lineread hitran.py for non-overlapping wavenumber range.
Added warning instead.

*****

Bumped Lineread to version 6.4.6.

*****

Fixed bug in extcoeff.c extinction().
The scale argument for downsample() was not being correctry rounded to
the nearest integer.


*****  Di 7. Jun 18:37:46 CEST 2016  *****

Edited downsample() such that it doesn't modify the previous values
stored in the 'out' input array.

*****

Revamped part of extcoeff() to skip broadening of lines much thinner
than the requested resolution.  This avoids a bug found in the
previous code, where the extinction-coefficient wasn't being correctly
calculated at some specific layers/wavelengths.
Note that this bug hasn't been fixed yet.
The speed improvement is small, I'd say just about 10% (for a hitemp
run on WASP-43b with 62 million lines from 0.85--5.0 um).

Some pending tasks are to find the right threshold where a line is
thin enough to avoid broadening without impacting the results.
At the moment 0.1x seems to be agood first approximation.

*****

Small edit in setup.py


*****  Mi 8. Jun 09:45:41 CEST 2016  *****

Minor reshufle in intensity() to take lines out of a loop.
Got a 5--15% speed up (0.05--0.1 sec) in the intensity spectrum
calculation for eclipse geometry.

Tried to integrate in log(tau) instead of tau, but could not get the
code to run fast enough or it simply broke.  After the update in
3708c3f this seems unnecessary, though UI might consider this in the
future if necessary.

*****

Updated default value of ethresh to 1e-9.
Which is more appropriate.

searched value lies close to the initial element in the array.

*****

Tweaked extcoeff() to skip the broadening of lines only when they
fall more than 10 Voigt widths away from the wavenumber sampling
divisions.

This solves previous sudden jumps in the extinction coefficient which
disrupted the integration into the optical depth.


*****  Mo 11. Jul 08:35:28 CEST 2016  *****

Fixed typo in last commit.  The code skip-broadening threshold was
set at 0.1 widths instead of 10.0.  Reset to 1.0 widths.

  inputs/filters/tutorial/

*****

Fixed typo in pbay driver.  Try only delete pre-existing opacity file
when the file exists.

*****

Fixed extinction-coefficient bug, first reported in 3708c3f.
It turned out that since I was letting the size of the Voigt profiles
of the un-calculated profiles equal to zero, extcoeff wasn't adding
the contribution of these lines, corrupting the EC at wavelengths
shorter than a certain threshold at a certain layers.

Set the broadening-skip threshold at 10 Voigt widths, because smaller
thresholds seem to cause EC jumps along the atmosphere.

*****

Fixed typo in getting-started docs.

Added hydro_m(), which is a HE calculation with variable g=GM/r**2.
Removed redundant hydro code from readatm.py.

In principle, in the future I will use hydro_m() when the planetary
mass is given.  If not, use hydro_g() with the input g.  But the code
is not ready yet (How to set the radius after the Hill radius?).

the previous results down to 0.03% difference.
Removed Pyton 2D-interpolation routine.
Added splinterp_2D() routine to spline.c (which in fact is a 1D
interpolation that repeats along second axis).
This resolves #18.

*****

Made haze parameters retrievable.
To determine whether haze models are retrievable, check if the number
of fitting parameters matches ntemp+nradius+nabund+nhaze.

Re-factored the alkali module.  Now make a grid of pre-computed Voigt
profiles (in initialization) instead of computing on the fly on each
run() call.  The routine now takes half the time to run.  Most time is
spent computing the extinction in the power-law regime.
Added arrbinsearch() to cutils.c to do a binsearch for an array of
values into another tabulated array.
Added alkali() function to vprofile.c to compte the Voigt profiles for the
grid of Lorentz and Doppler widths.

*****

Removed (deprecated) voigt() function from vprofile.c.

This resolves #87.

*****

Minor upgrade in simpson(), take even calculation out of the loop.
Fixed index typo in single-layer intensity calculation.

atmosphere was updating the radius profile without updating the
mean molecular mass. Now the fit() updates the reference radius, and
passes the task to reloadatm().
This resolves #85.

Re-implemented gray cloud model.
The new model is parameterized by the cloud top pressure (ptop).

The model sets the extinction (cm-1) such that the optical depth grows
to ~2/3 at ptop, creating a nearly instantaneous opaque layer.  The
extinction is zero above ptop, and scales proportional to the pressure
below ptop.

This is much easier to interpret than the previous gray model, and is
not linked to the H2 abundance, which was arbitrary and prone to
correlations for high-metallicity (ie, variable H2) retrievals.

Kept old gray model, renamed as ccsgray.

Turned pyrat.cs.molecules from a numpy array into a nested list to
avoid issues with string data types on prints.
Added 'CIA ' to output __repr__() and get_ec() calls.

*****

Fixed wrong config file in test that creates the 1.1-1.7 um tli file.

*****

The next merge enable travis CI testing.  Most of the code works in
Python2 and Python3 (some tli's are pending).

PFformat_Schwenke_TiO.py scripts.  These are now handled by the main
Pyrat Bay entry point, using the -pf argument.
The actual code is now implemented into the tools and io modules
(thus, they are accessible to the user through the API).

*****  Sat Mar 30 21:17:37 CET 2019  *****

Refactored io.read_spectrum() to handle custom file headers (comment
lines).  The very last comment line should define the wavelength
units (first non-blank string after the comment char and a blank).
If the units are not defined, assume wavelength units are microns.

*****

Removed wine module.
Moved wine.resample() to tools.resample(), refactored to handle a
generic signal with option to normalize (for filters), rather than
handling filters and stellar spectrum.

in atmosphere module's functions.

*****

Refactored Pyrat Bay initialization:
Moved input-parameter validations from driver.py and argum.py (and
others) into tools.parse().  If a parameter is defined with invalid
values, the code will break regardless of whether a parameter will
be used or not.

Redefined values involving wavenumber to always be in cm-1, thus,
such parameters must be defined as a floating-point number.
Removed wnunits input.

In tools.Namespace() class, added get_choices() method, refactored
get_param() to include the parameter description in the error output,
and refactored get_default() adding wlog arguments that flags when
to raise default warning.

Renamed argum.py checkinputs() to check_spectrum(). Pulled out
parameter parsing into parse(), left spectrum-specific checks.

Refactored Pyrat() init method to parse inputs from the config file
(taken from driver.py).  Move spectrum initialization into a separate
setup_spectrum() method for a more streamlined integration with the
Pyrat Bay driver.

Refactored driver.py's run() function accordingly.  Ideally, this
function should only run the appropriate checks, call the right
functions, and return their outputs.  It should not modify the Pyrat
instance itself.

Tests are working, but wont be updated before some cleaning up in
next commit.

*****  Di 29. Okt 09:16:33 CET 2019  *****

Refactored broadening.min_widths() to remove dlratio input argument
rather compute lorentz width from physical inputs.

The problem was that I was setting the Lorentz minimum based on
dlratio, as a function of the minimum doppler width.  if dlratio is
not small enough, the min lorentz did not sample the smallest values
expected for the atmosphere (at the lowest pressures).  After fixing
this, I can keep dlratio at 0.1 to avoid recomputing identical
profiles.

Simplified planetary mass units parsing.
(no change in behavior).

*****

Previous changes were for the planetary radius actually.
Now, simplified planetary mass units parsing.

*****

Changed behavior of default pressure units.
Remove punits default and warning.
If punits is None, attempt to get it from pbottom, ptop, refpressure,
and the atmfile, respectively.

*****  Mo 11. Nov 14:26:13 CET 2019  *****

Found bug in cloud deck model. More of a poor-approximation issue.
I was setting a vertical optical depth of ~2/3 at the layer below
the cloud top, whis some variation porportional to the proximity
of the layer to the cloud top.  The transition didn't turn out to
be as smooth as expected, with the outputs being 'discretized' to
the nearest layer.

Refactored the deck cloud model, removing its opacity, and adjusting
the outcome after the radiative-transfer integration.
For transmission, clip the output such that the transit depth is
larger than the cloud top.
For emission, set the black body emission of the layer below the
cloud top equal to that of a Planck function at the temperature at
the cloud top.

Patchy model is breaking now. Needs to be fixed.
Modified behavior of pyrat.get_ec()  as well.  Return an array of
zeros or ones depending on whether the requested layer is above or
below the cloud top, even though the codes does not use this
extinction coefficient.


*****  Di 12. Nov 10:34:19 CET 2019  *****

Adjusted opticaldepth() emission calculation to stop at the cloud top
if existing.


*****  Mi 13. Nov 14:07:01 CET 2019  *****

Reimplemented Simpson integration code to work on a 2D input,
now, we do the modulation integration at all wavelength in a single
call to the C code.  Apparently getting a speed up factor of two
for that step.

*****

It turns out, the transmission code still was not accurate enough
after the last changes.  Now, when there is a cloud deck, in the last
integration to get the transmision spectrum, the code replaces the
layer below the deck with the deck altitude, interpolating the
integrand.  This now produces a smooth variation when the cloud deck
crosses the atmospheric model layers.

Tweaked Deck()'s itop variable to be equal to the atmospheric layer
rather than below when the cloud sits exactly at the layer.
(This prevents NaNs when computing the transmission spectrum).

Updated tests.

*****

Added --show-capture=no option to pytest.ini.

*****

Allowed defining rayleigh models without rpars if and only if the
models do not require any parameter.

*****

Modified plots.transmittance() to fill in values below ideep with
zeros (fully opaque), which fixes a bug in plots.cf(), which was not

*****  Fri Nov 22 16:56:58 CET 2019  *****

Fixed log's verb argument in tools.parser.py to pass the defaulted
value (pyrat.verb instead of args.verb).

*****

Tweaked makesample.make_wavenumber() to show the resolution when
resolution argument is not None.


*****  Sun Dec  1 23:23:57 GMT 2019  *****

Modified read_extinction() function to update the spectral range
when ex.wn does not match spec.wn.  If pyrat.spec.wnlow or
pyrat.spec.wnhigh are narrower than input pyrat.ex.wn, then trim
the opacity table accordingly.
Do a check of whether this is constant delta-wavenumber or constant
resolution.  Preserve sampling from the opacity table (either
pyrat.spec.wnstep or pyrat.spec.resolution).
Oversampling values in pyrat.spec won't necessary reflect those used
for the opacity table, though they won't be used for any calculation
(should I None them?).
Re-interpolate pyrat.phy.starflux into pyrat.spec.starflux (if req.)
Re-compute filter passbands (if required).
Added tests.

Added modules used during radiative transfer as underscore modules
into the main pyratbay package (as under to avoid cluttering).

*****

Implemented io.export_pandexo() function to run pandexo simulations
from a pyrat object or create a pandexo_dict for it.
There is no testing so far, since pandexo relies on many dependencies
that are not easy to get into travis or might not be totally
compatible with the dependencies of pyratbay.

Bumped Pyrat Bay version to 0.9.0a2.


*****  Wed Mar 18 15:57:07 CET 2020  *****

Implemented Voigt wing cutoff at fixed value (in cm-1).
This applies when creating the Voigt profiles grid, but it also
can be modified when computing the extinction coefficient (though
if so, the cutoff has to be smaller than the input value, duh).
Set default to 25 cm-1 (typically used in the literature).
Thus, the code truncates each profile at the minimum value between
the vextent (in HWHM) and the vcutoff (in cm-1) values.
A vcutoff value of 0.0 results in no fixed cutoff.
Updated documentation.

*****

Updated vextent default value from 20.0 to 100.0 HWHM.
This and the previous commit is expected to change the values of the
(default) runs.  Updated tests accordingly.

Refactored the Three-channel Eddington model for temperature profiles
in the tcea() function in _pt.c.
Replaced beta with T_irr, moved T_int into the params array, and made
gravity an optional argument.  This removes the dependency on the

Fixed 'correction' of hydro_m() function when the model diverges for
super-puff atmospheres.
Print radius array using user-input radius units.
Added test of ultra-puff hydro_m() calculation.

*****

Removed Hill radius default to stellar radius.
I will probably regret this, but we will see.  I would not trust
ultra-puff runs even if rhill is defined (hydrostatic equilibrium
breaks way before the altitude gets closer to rhill anyway).


*****  Di 1. Sep 15:22:46 CEST 2020  *****

Enabled tli runs with a single pflist or dbtype value that applies to
all dblist values.

Fixed issue when setting fpatchy from the pyrat.eval() method
as a 1-element array instead of a float.  (was this a bug? was not
even breaking the code).

*****

If fpatchy is not None and using the lecavelier Rayleigh model,
put it's opacity into the cloud.ec array instead of rayleigh.ec
such that it gets affected by the fpatchy factor.
I don't really like this but it makes the code more compatible
with the Madhu articles.

*****

Got fpatchy transmission calculation back to work.
Added tests.

radiative-transfer schemes for transit or emission geometry.
Updated example config files.
Updated tests.

Renamed 'eclipse' rt_path option to 'emission' (more logic).

In plots.contribution() changed path argument to rt_path.
Allowed emission (instead of eclipse) and transit options.
